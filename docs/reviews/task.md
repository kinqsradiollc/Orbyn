## Plugin tool boundary structural limits — 3 October 2026

Isolated codex/plugin-tool-input-bounds follows frozen a74ad26a without editing
its original branch or the preserved node_modules link. Tool-call input now
checks finite JSON, at most 16 nested levels and 4096 values before policy/
capability dispatch. Existing 65,536-byte request limit, independent grant auth,
policy and execution remain active. Extra authority fields remain rejected.
12 focused JSON/resource/principal checks and backend typecheck pass. Initial
focused command failed due root esbuild platform installation; retry explicitly
uses the existing healthy Darwin binary without changing shared dependencies.
HTTP tests now assert excessive graphs400 with no argument echo; local DB gate
is unavailable, so those tests/full runtime are not claimed passed. OAuth host,
launch/resource/CSP/event/provider/tenant gates remain incomplete. No main merge.
