# ADR 001 — Orbyn agent, provider, plugin and document platform

Date: 30 September 2026. Status: **accepted architectural direction; implementation incomplete**.

## Context and scope

The user authorized implementation of the revised DevDay plan with production checkpoints on main. Voice, computer use and the speculative Decisions API integration are excluded. The existing durable assistant, source visibility, approvals, receipts, Docs and managed connections remain the foundation. The governing acceptance contract is [the revised implementation review](../reviews/devday-2026-implementation-review.md), including M1, D1 and U1. No removed feature is required to finish this ADR's scope.

## Decisions

### 1. Separate Orbyn identity, provider credentials and executor identity

OpenAI identity linking creates an Orbyn account/session after verified issuer, audience, subject and nonce checks. Existing-account linking requires authenticated proof, not matching email alone. First-party sign-in, connector grants and plan-use authorization are separate transactions. SIWC is presented first where an eligible implemented flow exists; managed/BYO providers remain supported. Eligibility gates are visible release constraints.

Plan access/refresh tokens live only in their authorized user-controlled runtime and are never stored in shared Orbyn backend databases or plugin infrastructure. Executor registrations carry user, account/workspace, connection and host identity; leases fence concurrent devices. A device cannot extend its owner's backend rights. Server mutations always run through typed capability policy, durable receipts and revision guards.

### 2. Connection-specific adapters and model defaults

Use a discriminated connection contract for managed, BYO and plan-local routes. Implement plan streaming Responses separately from managed adapters; reject unsupported request fields/tools locally before sending. Preserve cancellation, typed completion/failure and checkpoints through SSE reconnects. A plan request must not silently become a managed billed request.

The credential owner fetches the account's `/v1/models` catalog. Expose the first-party `/models` contract and model selection through an authenticated sanitized snapshot, with explicit freshness/account generation. Only display eligible list entries and preserve provider ordering. Default model is scoped to user + connection + account/workspace. Revalidate on inference, model list refresh, account change and revocation. Never use an arbitrary curated fallback for unavailable entitlements. Managed usage and plan usage remain distinct; estimates are not provider billing guarantees.

### 3. Typed rules extend current assistant ownership

Migrate the current named assistant into the multi-agent owner model while retaining memory, goals, routines and preferences. Text standing instructions are not executable policy. Typed rules bind action class, agent and space; deny wins over ask, ask over allow. Allow cannot override ownership, source restrictions, team policy, hard stops, budgets or stale revisions. Recheck policy at execution, apply and notification delivery.

Persist activity events with authorized replay cursors. Polling remains a recovery mechanism. Use durable work reservations and distinguish estimate, reported usage and billed usage. Background plan jobs defer when the runtime is absent unless the user explicitly permits managed fallback.

### 4. Plugin has its own authenticated backend integration

Create a separately routed integration module/process boundary for plugin launch contexts, UI resources, tool calls and events. It resolves connector principals and resource/audience scopes independently of first-party sessions. Plugin backend calls use approved managed/BYO credentials; they cannot borrow plan tokens or first-party `/models` defaults.

Reuse the capability registry and domain mutation services through an explicit adapter. Do not proxy arbitrary first-party routes, trust host metadata as authorization, or duplicate transaction/receipt code. UI resources use declared schemas, CSP and bounded inputs; callbacks/events are deduplicated and replay-safe. Existing MCP tools remain portable when extension UI is unavailable.

### 5. Markdown remains portable structured content

Extend existing blocks and parser; preserve source syntax, stable block anchors and document revisions. Adopt the explicit D1 matrix for CommonMark/GFM, code, math, footnotes, callouts, reference links/frontmatter, TOC and Mermaid diagram families. Provide source/rendered preview synchronization, contained scrolling and export parity across desktop/web/mobile.

All diagram rendering is strict, bounded and bundled/isolated. Document input cannot relax security, insert script, trigger arbitrary network access or grant file access. Unknown syntax remains source; parse errors are recoverable inline. Mobile diagram parity cannot be declared from its current flowchart-only implementation. Preserve source links and authorization through preview, publication and exports.

### 6. Shared pages and channels retain bounded authority

Assistant-owned blocks identify exact block revisions and writable scope. Human edits are conflict checked. Page mentions launch deduplicated scoped jobs; effective authority is an intersection of actor rights, agent scope and page permissions. Public snapshot/live publication requires explicit consent, revocation and current source checks. Slack/Teams connections require authorized installation and exact waiting-card identity for replies.

### 7. Production checkpoints require current evidence

Develop in the isolated worktree and merge scoped ready commits into main. Documentation acceptance does not imply product completion. Every checkpoint records tests, migrations, clean Docker builds where affected, typechecks and runtime proof. U1 requires desktop/mobile responsive and native interaction checks for affected features, with stale state and overlay races. External account/provider/platform access gates are recorded as incomplete until actually exercised.

## Alternatives rejected

- One shared adapter/token store for plan, managed and plugin: incompatible permissions, billing and request contracts.
- Plugin UI directly calling first-party APIs under the browser session: confuses connector grants and account authority.
- Treating a model slug as globally entitled: catalogs and defaults vary by account/workspace.
- Replacing all existing editor blocks with a new renderer: loses anchors, suggestions and current document contracts.
- Arbitrary VS Code extension parity or executable HTML: unbounded behavior outside D1 and unsafe for shared documents.
- Merging partially verified product code because typechecks pass: does not establish UI/runtime correctness.

## Consequences and migration

New connection/executor, catalog/default, typed rule/agent ownership, activity, block binding and publication records will require versioned schemas and retention rules. Migrations preserve existing managed connections, named-agent settings and document source/anchors. The next implementation checkpoint must inventory exact current schema and affected clients before introducing migrations. Version API contracts in core/API client and include clean image dependency coverage, including the already repaired backend API-client packaging.

## Acceptance and current state

This ADR is complete as an architectural decision. Product implementation remains open in C1–C6, with per-feature acceptance criteria in the governing artifact. No OAuth runtime, new `/models` route, typed rules, mobile Mermaid parity, plugin service or UI repair is claimed by this documentation checkpoint.

### Integration constraint — 2 October 2026

Main now includes companion wardrobe and assistant chat redesign (`7c96f70`) and
companion editor save visibility (`e4370a3`). Preserve those characters, controls
and styling when integrating the broader platform and UI changes. Qualification
on an older main base does not qualify the combined version: integrate current
main and rerun the affected checks before each application checkpoint.

Assigned-source ownership candidate `b7bd994` on draft PR #139 adds a database
guard across Background/Overnight lanes and shared-task members. Its focused
tests, types, build and formatting passed; full local/CI qualification remains
running. It is not merged and has not yet incorporated the latest character
main. Handoff acknowledgment source `6fd43f4` derives receiving outcomes from
current completed-job evidence, checks producer revision and both jobs' access,
and serializes idempotent retries. The combined contract/storage/request checks
passed 27/27, with backend types and formatting. It does not enable dispatch,
grant receiving authority or prove separate-worker collaboration.

Docs PR #138 CI is now green on `25e1e6f`; web/mobile-web and native Android
interaction gates remain open. The governing review and implementation handoff
retain the full remaining scope; these checkpoints do not complete the ADR.
