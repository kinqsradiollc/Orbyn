# ADR 001 — Orbyn agent, provider, plugin and document platform

Date: 30 September 2026. Status: **accepted architectural direction; implementation incomplete**.

## Context and scope

The user authorized implementation of the revised DevDay plan with production checkpoints on main. Voice, computer use and the speculative Decisions API integration are excluded. The existing durable assistant, source visibility, approvals, receipts, Docs and managed connections remain the foundation. The governing acceptance contract is [the revised implementation review](../reviews/devday-2026-implementation-review.md), including M1, D1 and U1. No removed feature is required to finish this ADR's scope.

## Decisions

### 1. Separate Orbyn identity, provider credentials and executor identity

OpenAI identity linking creates an Orbyn account/session after verified issuer, audience, subject and nonce checks. Existing-account linking requires authenticated proof, not matching email alone. First-party sign-in, connector grants and plan-use authorization are separate transactions. SIWC is presented first where an eligible implemented flow exists; managed/BYO providers remain supported. Eligibility gates are visible release constraints.

Plan access/refresh tokens live only in their authorized user-controlled runtime and are never stored in shared Orbyn backend databases or plugin infrastructure. Executor registrations carry user, account/workspace, connection and host identity; leases fence concurrent devices. A device cannot extend its owner's backend rights. Server mutations always run through typed capability policy, durable receipts and revision guards.

### 2. Connection-specific adapters and model defaults

Use a discriminated connection contract for managed, BYO and plan-local routes. Implement plan streaming Responses separately from managed adapters; reject unsupported request fields/tools locally before sending. Preserve cancellation, typed completion/failure and checkpoints through SSE reconnects. A plan request must not silently become a managed billed request.

The credential owner fetches the account's `/v1/models` catalog. Expose the first-party `/models` contract and model selection through an authenticated sanitized snapshot, with explicit freshness/account generation. Only display eligible list entries and preserve provider ordering. Default model is scoped to user + connection + account/workspace. Revalidate on inference, model list refresh, account change and revocation. Never use an arbitrary curated fallback for unavailable entitlements. Managed usage and plan usage remain distinct; estimates are not provider billing guarantees.

### 3. Typed rules extend current assistant ownership

Migrate the current named assistant into the multi-agent owner model while retaining memory, goals, routines and preferences. Text standing instructions are not executable policy. Typed rules bind action class, agent and space; deny wins over ask, ask over allow. Allow cannot override ownership, source restrictions, team policy, hard stops, budgets or stale revisions. Recheck policy at execution, apply and notification delivery.

Persist activity events with authorized replay cursors. Polling remains a recovery mechanism. Use durable work reservations and distinguish estimate, reported usage and billed usage. Background plan jobs defer when the runtime is absent unless the user explicitly permits managed fallback.

### 4. Plugin has its own authenticated backend integration

Create a separately routed integration module/process boundary for plugin launch contexts, UI resources, tool calls and events. It resolves connector principals and resource/audience scopes independently of first-party sessions. Plugin backend calls use approved managed/BYO credentials; they cannot borrow plan tokens or first-party `/models` defaults.

Reuse the capability registry and domain mutation services through an explicit adapter. Do not proxy arbitrary first-party routes, trust host metadata as authorization, or duplicate transaction/receipt code. UI resources use declared schemas, CSP and bounded inputs; callbacks/events are deduplicated and replay-safe. Existing MCP tools remain portable when extension UI is unavailable.

### 5. Markdown remains portable structured content

Extend existing blocks and parser; preserve source syntax, stable block anchors and document revisions. Adopt the explicit D1 matrix for CommonMark/GFM, code, math, footnotes, callouts, reference links/frontmatter, TOC and Mermaid diagram families. Provide source/rendered preview synchronization, contained scrolling and export parity across desktop/web/mobile.

All diagram rendering is strict, bounded and bundled/isolated. Document input cannot relax security, insert script, trigger arbitrary network access or grant file access. Unknown syntax remains source; parse errors are recoverable inline. Mobile diagram parity cannot be declared from its current flowchart-only implementation. Preserve source links and authorization through preview, publication and exports.

### 6. Shared pages and channels retain bounded authority

Assistant-owned blocks identify exact block revisions and writable scope. Human edits are conflict checked. Page mentions launch deduplicated scoped jobs; effective authority is an intersection of actor rights, agent scope and page permissions. Public snapshot/live publication requires explicit consent, revocation and current source checks. Slack/Teams connections require authorized installation and exact waiting-card identity for replies.

### 7. Production checkpoints require current evidence

Develop in the isolated worktree and merge scoped ready commits into main. Documentation acceptance does not imply product completion. Every checkpoint records tests, migrations, clean Docker builds where affected, typechecks and runtime proof. U1 requires desktop/mobile responsive and native interaction checks for affected features, with stale state and overlay races. External account/provider/platform access gates are recorded as incomplete until actually exercised.

## Alternatives rejected

- One shared adapter/token store for plan, managed and plugin: incompatible permissions, billing and request contracts.
- Plugin UI directly calling first-party APIs under the browser session: confuses connector grants and account authority.
- Treating a model slug as globally entitled: catalogs and defaults vary by account/workspace.
- Replacing all existing editor blocks with a new renderer: loses anchors, suggestions and current document contracts.
- Arbitrary VS Code extension parity or executable HTML: unbounded behavior outside D1 and unsafe for shared documents.
- Merging partially verified product code because typechecks pass: does not establish UI/runtime correctness.

## Consequences and migration

New connection/executor, catalog/default, typed rule/agent ownership, activity, block binding and publication records will require versioned schemas and retention rules. Migrations preserve existing managed connections, named-agent settings and document source/anchors. The next implementation checkpoint must inventory exact current schema and affected clients before introducing migrations. Version API contracts in core/API client and include clean image dependency coverage, including the already repaired backend API-client packaging.

## Acceptance and current state

This ADR is complete as an architectural decision. Product implementation remains open in C1–C6, with per-feature acceptance criteria in the governing artifact. No OAuth runtime, new `/models` route, typed rules, mobile Mermaid parity, plugin service or UI repair is claimed by this documentation checkpoint.

### Integration constraint — 2 October 2026

Main now includes companion wardrobe and assistant chat redesign (`7c96f70`) and
companion editor save visibility (`e4370a3`). Preserve those characters, controls
and styling when integrating the broader platform and UI changes. Qualification
on an older main base does not qualify the combined version: integrate current
main and rerun the affected checks before each application checkpoint.

Assigned-source ownership PR #139 is merged as main `76ec92b`, from candidate
`51ce91b`, preserving the current character implementation. Its database guard
serializes Background/Overnight ownership across shared-task members. It also
corrects six off-scale character/assistant font sizes in both clients. Focused
checks, all workspace types, production builds and formatting passed. The full
local suite passed 2,103/2,103; CI passed all jobs with 2,102 backend passes,
zero failures and one Tesseract skip. Separate compiled processes verified the
guard; main has the same tree as the qualified source and CI merge commit.
This is a merged checkpoint, not a deployment or whole-app UI completion.

Handoff acknowledgment source `6fd43f4` derives receiving outcomes from
current completed-job evidence, checks producer revision and both jobs' access,
and serializes idempotent retries. The combined contract/storage/request checks
passed 27/27, with backend types and formatting. It does not enable dispatch,
grant receiving authority or prove separate-worker collaboration. Source
`deb93cb`/`114bb2d` also derives durable failure reasons without copying provider
error text or restricted outcomes; its 32 contract/storage/request checks and
backend types passed. Handoff services remain unmerged and unwired.

Docs PR #138 had green CI on `25e1e6f`; combined character candidate `788161e`
passed 37 focused checks, all types/build/format, with new CI still running.
Its fresh native verification is blocked by an iOS password-save prompt, pending
the user's dismissal. Web/mobile-web and native Android interaction gates remain
open. The governing review and implementation handoff
retain the full remaining scope; these checkpoints do not complete the ADR.

### Activity checkpoint and scope continuity — 2 October 2026

PR #140 is merged as main `9e7e505`, from frozen candidate `01b8757`.
Migration 210 records content-free job transitions in separate owner/runtime
streams with monotonic replay cursors and 90-day event retention. The private
read route and typed client recheck current source visibility. Polling,
heartbeats and checkpoint-only writes do not fabricate work activity.
The fresh marked database suite passed 2,112/2,112, with no failures, skips or
cancellations. Workspace types, production builds and full formatting passed;
all four CI jobs passed. Candidate, CI merge and resulting main trees are
identical (`f62fdf5209f0dfb77b60ccb5788724c005742d04`). No deployment occurred.

The governing revised implementation review remains the full acceptance
contract. This checkpoint does not narrow it to assistant chat or activity:
whole-app layout, Docs editing/rendering/export, views and settings, provider
and embedding options, actual account-specific model execution, separate plugin
integration, typed agent rules, durable budgets and bounded cross-runtime
collaboration remain required. Web/desktop features require mobile parity.
Preserve main's character work and Orbyn's palette. Unverified responsive/native
behavior and external integration gates remain open. Related worktree cleanup
comes after integration and qualification, without discarding retained work.

### Independent Overnight scheduling checkpoint — 2 October 2026

PR #141 is merged as main `7f3894f`, from frozen candidate `9b87ce3`.
The scheduler's per-owner busy check now applies to Overnight jobs; unrelated
queued/running Background or interactive jobs cannot starve its night work.
Own-lane serialization and the shared-task ownership guard remain enforced.
Four new regression cases failed before the correction. Afterward, the focused
night/runtime/ownership suite passed 53/53 and the fresh full local suite passed
2,120/2,120 with no failures, skips or cancellations. All workspace types,
production builds and full formatting passed; every CI job passed. Candidate,
GitHub merge and resulting main trees match
`3e2d1b8410f139b625c88036679d62a77c08caca`. No deployment occurred.

This completes a scheduler checkpoint, not bounded handoff dispatch or full A4.
Typed rules, agent ownership records, durable budgets, receiving authorization
and cross-runtime round trips still require integration. The whole-app D1/U1,
provider/model, plugin and mobile parity deliverables remain in scope.

### Qualified source privacy and parent deletion checkpoint — 2 October 2026

PR **#144** is merged as main **eccf338**, from frozen candidate **f79c852** on
base **dabb770**. Migration 213 prevents account/team cascades from recreating
history-access metadata for a disappearing parent; ordinary target deletion
retains original owner/team history. Personal notice enqueue/inbox/push delivery
checks job-only dependencies; Review summaries, counts, outcomes and saved
notices omit unavailable producing-job sources. No production data was touched
during reproduction. Current access protection does not prove source revisions.

Fresh marked database full local suite passed **2,151/2,151**, no failures/skips/
cancellations (563,046 ms); combined focused suite **69/69** passed. All workspace
types, production builds and full formatting passed. Every CI job
**36996647235** passed. Candidate, GitHub merge **2f1984a** and resulting main
trees match **a903b6c7158871b05472e3afb54d824290df80fa**. No deployment occurred.

The entire revised acceptance contract remains active: account-specific real
model execution/defaults, provider/embedding options, separate plugin backend
and supported host integration, full Docs Markdown/Mermaid parity, whole-app
web/desktop/mobile UX, independent agent profiles and bounded authorized
collaboration, typed ownership/rules/editor, reviewed source revisions and
budget reservations. Public rule editor remains disabled. Preserve character
work, Orbyn palette and mobile parity; cleanup follows complete integration and
qualification. Voice/computer-use product features and speculative Decisions
remain outside scope.

### Qualified current assistant authority checkpoint — 2 October 2026

PR #145 merged as main **3450e87**, from frozen candidate **04d1ff7** on
base **456e01a**. Each capability reloads the current owned active assistant
grant and intersects it with server-selected caller restrictions. Current
Personal/team access, team role/policy, toolsets, trust, approval exceptions and
outside-content restrictions cannot expand earlier authority. Reads use primary;
writes serialize grant changes. Typed rule revision fences remain in place.

Exact candidate full local suite passed **2,157/2,157**, zero failures, skips or
cancellations,556,800ms, on fresh marked **orbyn_authority_04d1ff7_test**. Workspace
types, production builds and full formatting passed. All CI **37000288172** jobs
passed; backend passed2,156 with one Tesseract skip and zero failures. CI checked
merge **a94a7c4**. Candidate, CI merge and resulting main trees are identical
**94774365fcabd2b7d331d35a3d110880dce5a641**. Main fast-forward preserved user
mobile/app.json and unrelated files. No deployment occurred.

Source **c237cfb** additionally binds cached assistant results to effective
authority and rechecks producing-job/container/current sources. Its72 focused
checks and backend types/format passed, but it remains unmerged pending complete
cached-target authorization, grant-scoped dependency closure and source revision/
concurrency proof. Private receiving handoffs/budgets, typed read/effect/notice
policy, agent ownership/editor, full real account models/providers/embeddings,
plugin host acceptance, complete Docs/Mermaid and whole-app web/desktop/mobile
UI gates remain required. Preserve Orbyn palette and characters. Saved web
preview denial remains respected; cleanup follows complete integration and
qualification. Voice/computer-use product features and speculative Decisions
remain outside scope; the full ADR goal remains active.

### Qualified cached assistant result checkpoint — 2 October 2026

PR #146 merged as main **c9b6c78**, from frozen **0033a96** on unchanged base
**7c08aa6**. Assistant cached write results bind to current effective authority
and recheck producing job/container/source access, grant-scoped source visibility
and typed targets/structured links across the32 produced receipt families. A held
result does not repeat the mutation; restoring target access can return the
original answer. Ordinary connector replay remains unchanged.

Exact candidate local full suite passed **2,176/2,176**, zero failures, skips or
cancellations,556,169ms. All workspace types, production builds and full formatting
passed. All CI **37003294826** jobs succeeded; backend passed2,175 with one
Tesseract-dependent skip and zero failures. CI merge **cd57b95**, candidate and
resulting main have identical tree **0d1f05994b7ed460131fe2e16ba9d3ad4ce59222**.
Local main fast-forward preserved user mobile/app.json and unrelated files.

This checkpoint does not complete replay security or the full ADR. Original
provider-read revisions, nested dependency closure, concurrent source fences and
other persisted result paths remain open. Completed document draft replay is a
separate source follow-up, not in this merge. Receiving handoffs/budgets, typed
read/effect/notice policy, owner/editor UX, actual models/defaults/execution,
providers/embeddings, separate plugin host acceptance, complete Docs/Mermaid and
whole-app web/desktop/mobile acceptance remain required. Preserve palette and
characters. No deployment or cleanup occurred; voice/computer-use product
features and the speculative Decisions adapter remain excluded.

### Qualified completed document draft checkpoint — 2 October 2026

PR #147 merged as main **4bbcfec**, from frozen **53089fd** on base
**e1d46af**, at 12:25:15 UTC. Completed append_doc answers replayed under a
new client_ref now recheck producing evidence and destination access before
returning saved titles, identities or links. Restored access returns the saved
answer without another page mutation. Five focused regressions cover unchanged
access, excluded projects, deleted destinations, narrowed personal access and
restored access. Ordinary connector guards remain unchanged.

Exact candidate local full suite passed **2,181/2,181**, zero failures, skips or
cancellations, 590,567 ms, on fresh marked orbyn_draft_candidate_test. All
workspace types, production builds and full formatting passed. All CI
**37004911014** jobs succeeded; backend passed 2,180 with one Tesseract skip.
CI merge **94006ee**, candidate and resulting main have identical tree
**ab575239dd8e10fab7a52d32946a75a1229ab95f**. Local main fast-forward preserved
user mobile/app.json and unrelated files.

This closes the completed-draft fast path only. Original provider-read revisions,
nested dependency closure and concurrent source fences remain open, alongside
models/defaults/execution, providers/embeddings, separate plugin integration,
agent collaboration/reflection and whole-app Docs/UI acceptance. Preserve palette
and characters; voice/computer-use product features remain excluded. No
deployment or cleanup occurred. The full ADR remains active.

### Home agent presentation — 3 October 2026

Apply the user’s Muse/Dots direction to both public and signed-in Home, with native
parity. Research: [Muse design](https://introducing.muse.ai/) emphasizes visible
background activity, meaningful interruptions, and task-shaped outputs;
[official Dots documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots) describes work
between conversations and separate task activity. These inform the presentation,
not additional Orbyn capabilities or blanket permission to act.

Home should explain a concrete responsibility and where to review its result.
Public examples must be labeled examples, never fabricated live runs. Use two
plain editorial rows for Background and Overnight, with separate timing and
morning review descriptions; keep character customization distinct from work.
Signed-in Home opens real permission-filtered profiles with activity and outputs.
Idle must remain idle when no authorized work exists. Reflection and inter-agent
collaboration remain existing acceptance gates, not advertised completed features.
Preserve Orbyn tokens and character preferences; avoid generic slogans and a
repeated grid of decorative feature cards.

The user owns web visual validation on their test server for this increment.
Code/build checks do not establish visual acceptance. Native screenshot and
interaction acceptance remains required and the disposable account’s terms
confirmation is still pending.

### Home copy follow-up — 3 October 2026

Replace vague first-screen metaphors with tasks, calendar, project notes and
delegated work. Present Background and Overnight as separate work schedules,
with an explicit review destination for each. Label illustrative requests as
examples and keep idle behavior truthful. Muse informs visible activity and
meaningful interruptions; Dots informs work between conversations. Their
capabilities do not establish capabilities in Orbyn. Reflection and collaboration
remain open acceptance gates. This follow-up changes copy only; the user’s web
visual validation and native acceptance remain outstanding.

### Home responsibility and review layout — 3 October 2026

Follow-up research confirms the useful presentation patterns: Muse puts activity
and approved permissions behind the avatar; Dots brings back results and asks
for decisions between conversations. Use the primary sources linked above.
Orbyn adopts visible responsibility, review destinations and pause conditions.
It does not inherit their cloud computers, app access or always-on execution.

Public Home uses a straight, in-flow planner example and two editorial agent rows
with labeled requests, review destinations and stopping conditions. Shared core
copy keeps the web and native signed-in Home descriptions consistent. No status
or output is fabricated. Reflection and collaboration remain open acceptance
gates. All character presets remain available; browsing never changes identity.
Web visual acceptance belongs to the user's test-server review for this increment;
native screenshot and interaction acceptance remains open.

### Home responsibilities before decoration — 3 October 2026

Rechecked primary product references: [Muse's design account](https://introducing.muse.ai/)
puts work status, activity and approved permissions behind the avatar, and describes
notifications for meaningful results or input. [Dots documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots)
describes ongoing responsibilities between conversations. Use those interaction
patterns to explain Orbyn's existing work; they do not prove Orbyn has the same tools.

Public Home now gives Background and Overnight their own section before the feature
catalog and character gallery. Navigation opens the agents section. Each has a timing,
a labeled example request, a review destination and a stopping condition. Replace
vague supporting slogans with specific task, calendar, project and review copy.
Character presets stay available in their own section. Signed-in web/native Home
must show the same timing and pause details alongside their existing activity entry.
No fake running states, always-on promise or completed reflection claim is introduced.
Code tests establish content and ordering, not screenshot acceptance. The user's
test-server web review and native visual acceptance remain open.

### Saved-revision export API checkpoint — 3 October 2026

Optional expected document versions protect file exports against concurrent
changes. Check visibility first, then return409 for any format at a different
saved revision. Invalid versions use the established422 schema response. Shared
clients carry the revision and never silently retry against a newer one.
Unversioned callers keep their existing behavior. The isolated candidate passes
17 export API checks, one real client check, all workspace types and production
builds. Exact-head CI remains required before merging this checkpoint.

This is API foundation only: both editors still need explicit save-success and
offline/failure handling, revision capture and all share-path integration.
Rendered PDF, publication, native sharing and whole D1/U1 acceptance remain open.

### Primary reads for file actions — 3 October 2026

Export file transport does not carry the ordinary JSON transport's read-after-write
header. Lag-tolerant replica reads could falsely reject a newly saved revision or
return older content/visibility. Both the file export route and its legacy Markdown
route now use the primary for the document and task/link permission enrichment.
This gives file actions current primary state even for existing unversioned callers.
Current-version conflicts and visibility-first404 behavior remain unchanged.
Regression checks execute the actual handlers with distinct primary and replica
dependencies; no export query or helper may use the stale replica. This is a
backend freshness checkpoint; PDF visual rendering and full D1/U1 remain open.

### Public Home request examples — 3 October 2026

[Muse's design account](https://introducing.muse.ai/) describes task-shaped outputs
and meaningful updates. [Dots' profile documentation](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001530-getting-started-with-your-dot)
exposes activity and task controls. Use those presentation patterns to make
Orbyn's existing responsibilities easier to understand. Public Home now gives
each agent a labeled example quotation, followed by where to review the work
and when it pauses. Preserve all character presets, Orbyn tokens and truthful
idle behavior. This checkpoint changes public presentation only; signed-in/native
Home refinements remain in the larger candidate. Reflection/collaboration and
the full ADR acceptance gates remain open. User test-server visual review is
still outstanding; automated content checks do not prove visual acceptance.

### Home responsibilities and product copy — 3 October 2026

Latest user direction: Background and Overnight should feel like personal agents
with ongoing responsibilities, informed by Muse and Dots. Both public Home and
signed-in Home must explain the product in concrete language and preserve mobile
parity. Avoid invented live status, generic AI slogans and capability claims that
have not passed the governing acceptance contract.

Primary references rechecked:

- [Muse's design account](https://introducing.muse.ai/): task-shaped outputs,
  visible activity and notifications worth interrupting for.
- [Meet dots](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots): work between conversations,
  continued responsibilities and decisions brought back for human review.
- [Dots tasks and memory](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots/tasks-and-memory):
  distinct task context, reviewable outputs and explicit recurring work.

These are product references; Orbyn does not inherit their computer, browser,
voice, messaging, account access or arbitrary action capabilities.

This increment changes Home content and layout, not worker capabilities. The
public workflow collapses to one column at narrow widths; signed-in guide content
wraps and native content grows naturally. Web visual acceptance remains with the
user's test server for this increment. Native screenshot/interaction acceptance
and the complete U1 gates remain open. Retain current character work and palette.

Public Home promotion candidate: based on main9702f19e, includes only shared
copy, the public page's workflow layout, its focused checks and this ADR section.
Signed-in Home/profile and renderer work remain in the larger draft. Local Home
checks3/3, all workspace typechecks/builds and full formatting pass. Web visual
acceptance is still delegated to the user's test server for this increment;
full exact-head local and CI qualification is required before main merge.

### Main-based rendered PDF checkpoint — 3 October 2026

Add a separately authenticated offline document renderer process and required
shared helpers, with a dedicated Chromium image, credential/network isolation,
enabled sandbox and bounded work/cancellation. The API authorizes primary-read
snapshots and rechecks access/version before returning a file. Signed requests
retain replay nonces until signature expiry, including allowed clock skew.
Production rollout starts PDF before API and validates its independent key.

This checkpoint prints math and all ten Mermaid families through the existing
PDF export contract shared by web, desktop and mobile. Standalone HTML gets
escaped source markers; this does not claim complete rendered HTML, publication,
inline image-byte or native sharing acceptance. Root-locked first-party build
dependencies generate only the backend asset; no app module imports are added.
Web/native editor and settings changes remain in their respective candidates.

Qualification requires focused real export tests, full local suite, workspace
types/build/format and exact-head CI including the hardened renderer image.
Main promotion remains conditional on those results. Full C1–C6/M1/D1/U1 scope
remains active; no deployment, release or cleanup is performed.

## Qualification correction — 3 October 2026

- Main21c6c076 full local suite is terminal:2,245/2,246, one old clipboard expectation for `<h2>Plan</h2>` after authored level1 correctly becameh1. Updated that expectation and added exact all-six-level HTML/clipboard regressions; no h7. h4–h6 print at readable body size. [Heading fixture](pdf-heading-levels.png) inspected with no overlap or clipping.
- Combineda039f271 CI37057124805 failed one all-family PDF text assertion despite local2,488/2,488. Reproduced in a hardened offline Linux renderer: “flowchart” prints correctly but pdf.js returns adjacent `fl`/`owchart` font runs. The test inserted a false space. Position-based line reconstruction and normalization now recover all ten exact headings and all six required SVG labels from the Linux file. A regression covers split font runs and ligatures; expected headings are exact line checks.
  -Current57 browser/helper/service/primary/deployment units and63 actual export/rich-page/heading/text checks pass. All workspace types/build/full formatting pass after the fix. Linux diagnostic artifact is `/tmp/orbyn-pdf-linux-api-batch.pdf`; its older image isolates printing/font behavior and is not current-head image qualification.
  -New full exact-head local and CI qualification required after committing this correction. Previous main/combined CI failures are not passing evidence. PR161 stays draft until corrected full local/all CI pass; no main merge/deploy/release/cleanup.

### Authorized picture snapshots for PDF and HTML — 3 October 2026

Candidate follows the qualified PDF checkpoint and uses the same endpoint on all
clients. Export authorized raster bytes as inert data URIs rather than omitting
pictures. Authorize on the primary, fetch only bounded signed first-party paths,
keep credentials/network out of the renderer, and recheck page/file access before
delivery. Missing/revoked pictures must fail explicitly rather than produce a
caption-only partial file. Preserve copied-file reference access when the original
page is removed. Evidence: `docs/reviews/evidence/doc-export-images.md`.

This closes the candidate's PDF/HTML picture-byte gap, subject to full current-head
qualification. It does not close native sharing, complete rendered HTML/publication,
Word/export/editor parity or broader C1–C6/M1/D1/U1 acceptance. Goal remains active.

### Portable rendered HTML candidate — 3 October 2026

Use the private first-party renderer for the existing HTML export endpoint as
well as PDF. Bind internal signatures to output format, share replay/concurrency
limits, render inert SVG images and MathML, retain escaped source, and install
script/frame/network-denying CSP before content. Keep screen styles with bounded
print overrides under media rules. Recheck current page/file authority before
sending the complete file. Evidence: `docs/reviews/evidence/doc-rendered-html.md`.

Candidate is stacked on the image export checkpoint, not yet qualified for main.
Publication, source/editor/Word parity, native interaction and the remaining full
ADR gates still require implementation/acceptance; the objective remains active.

### Signed-in Home/profile promotion candidate — 3 October 2026

Extract the signed-in Home guide and separate agent profiles from the larger
candidate onto current main (`192cb475`), with matching web/desktop and native
entry points. Keep the same shared Background/Overnight requests and workflow
steps as public Home. Replace the generic companion subtitle with “Background
progress and Overnight results.” Browse every character preset without changing
account settings. Profile activity, last work and outputs come from a private,
permission-filtered primary snapshot; refresh and avatar presence are not work.

The profile contract distinguishes idle, queued/recovering, working, waiting and
scheduled states. Overnight alone has a night window and estimated budget. Each
lane keeps its own activity and outputs. Open completed work only when the current
interactive chat can safely switch. User-facing activity labels are shared by
both clients; structured state is validated independently of copy.

Research remains the primary [Muse design account](https://introducing.muse.ai/)
and [Dots tasks and memory](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots/tasks-and-memory).
Their useful presentation patterns inform reviewable responsibilities; this
candidate adds no browser, computer, voice or external messaging capabilities.

Focused profile/store/client/Home checks pass 22/22. The first typecheck exposed
an omitted shared activity-label export; the scoped prerequisite was added and
current qualification continues. Full local/all-CI results, web test-server visual
acceptance and native screenshot/interaction acceptance are separate gates. No
claim of full U1, reflection or collaboration completion follows from this Home
increment.
